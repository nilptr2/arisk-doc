### Field Description

<ParamField body="metrics" type="string[]" optional>
  Analysis metrics list. If not provided or an empty array is passed, all supported metrics are returned by default.
  
  **Validation Rules**:
  *   Input values must be within the supported metrics list; otherwise, a `400 Invalid Params` error is returned.
  *   Duplicate items in the array will be automatically removed, and the response results will maintain the order of the metrics in the request as much as possible.
