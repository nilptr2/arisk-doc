title: "Transaction Detection"
description: "Webhook notification triggered when a monitored address has a transaction or a risk transaction is detected."
---

Arisk monitors the transaction activity of monitored addresses in real-time. When an inflow/outflow transaction occurs, or an interaction with a known risk address is detected, this alert is pushed.

### Push Type
Supports the following three types:
- `transaction_risk`: Risk transaction detected.
- `transaction_in`: Normal inflow transaction detected.
- `transaction_out`: Normal outflow transaction detected.

### Request Parameters

| `type` | `string` | Push type: `transaction_risk`, `transaction_in`, `transaction_out` |
| `timestamp` | `number` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when pushed |
| `alert` | `object` | Alert details object |
| `alert.id` | `string` | Unique alert ID |
| `alert.chain` | `string` | Chain type |

| `alert.counterparty` | `string` | Counterparty address |
| `alert.tx_hash` | `string` | Transaction hash |
| `alert.amount` | `string` | Transaction amount (string format) |
| `alert.direction` | `number` | `0`: Inflow to monitored address, `1`: Outflow from monitored address |
| `alert.block_number` | `number` | Block height |
