---

Arisk V2 sends real-time HTTP POST requests via Webhooks to your configured server to notify you of risk level changes or risk transactions for monitored addresses.

## Security Verification

To ensure the authenticity and integrity of the messages, every Webhook request sent by Arisk includes a digital signature. We strongly recommend verifying the request before processing.

### HTTP Headers

Each Webhook request contains the following key headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **X-Arisk-Signature** | RSA-PSS digital signature (Base64 encoded) | `aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=...` |
| **Authorization** | Bearer Token (only if `auth_key` is configured) | `Bearer your-secret-token` |

### Verification Steps

1.  **Verify Signature (Required)**
    *   **Algorithm**: RSA-PSS with SHA-256
    *   **Signed Content**: Raw JSON string of the request body
    *   **Public Key**: Use the Arisk RSA public key below to verify the signature in `X-Arisk-Signature`.

2.  **Verify Authorization (Optional)**
    If you set an `auth_key` in the Webhook configuration, Arisk will add the following header:
    `Authorization: Bearer <your_auth_key>`

## Best Practices

- **Fast Response (Required)**
  Your server should return an HTTP 200 OK status code immediately upon receiving a Webhook request.
  - **Response Data**: The response body can be empty or a simple JSON (e.g., `{"message": "received"}`). Our service only validates the HTTP status code and does not parse the response body content.
  - **Timeout Risk**: Please avoid performing time-consuming operations in the synchronous request, otherwise, it may trigger the sender's timeout retry mechanism (default timeout is usually short).

- **Asynchronous Processing (Recommended)**
  We recommend adopting a **"acknowledge first, process later"** strategy. That is, after validating the signature and receiving the data, immediately return an HTTP 200 response, and then place time-consuming business logic (such as database writes, cascading notifications, etc.) into a background queue for asynchronous processing to ensure high availability of the interface.

- **Idempotency Guarantee (Critical)**
  Due to network fluctuations or retry mechanisms, you may receive duplicate Webhook notifications. Please ensure to use the `alert.id` field in the Payload as a unique key for idempotency checks in your business layer.
